# Amps

Do you think your phone is charging slowly? This app lets you check if your charger/cable is working!

Measure how quickly your battery is charging/discharging. Immediately. No waiting!

Not every device is supported. Not mA accurate but as accurate as can be. This software is still in alpha. Android 4.2.2+

Please send any questions or comments so I can improve this app.
